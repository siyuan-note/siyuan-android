## About Multi-Channel Software Distribution

If you are using Android Studio's **Build** -> **Generate Signed Bundle APK...** method to build your program, please ignore the following content.

**The following content is only necessary when executing in the command line console**:

### Steps

1. Copy `signings.templates.gradle` and rename it as `signings.gradle`.
2. Configure information in `signings.gradle`.
3. Navigate to the project root directory using the console and execute the following commands:
```shell
# For Windows
.\gradlew clean assembleXiaomiRelease bundleGoogleplayRelease bundleHuaweiRelease assembleOfficialRelease

# For Linux
gradle clean assembleXiaomiRelease bundleGoogleplayRelease bundleHuaweiRelease assembleOfficialRelease
```
The naming convention here is:
```txt
assemble/bundle Xiaomi Debug/Release
```
`assemble` generates APK.
`bundle` generates AAB.
`Xiaomi` is the channel package name; refer to the location specified in `flavors.gradle productFlavors {}` configuration.
`Debug/Release`: Testing version/Official version.

4. After execution, you can find the generated program at these locations:
```txt
siyuan-android\app\build\outputs\apk\*     // APK location
siyuan-android\app\build\outputs\bundle\*  // AAB location
```
