## About Multi-Channel Software Distribution


If you are building your program using the Android Studio method of going to 【Build】,【Generate Signed Bundle APK...】, you only need to modify the `siyuanVersionName` and `siyuanVersionCode` within the build.gradle file at the project level. After making the changes, you can directly package the app and ignore the following content.

**The following content is only necessary when building via the command line console**:

When building using the command line console, you not only need to modify the `siyuanVersionName` and `siyuanVersionCode` within the build.gradle file at the project level, but you also need to perform the following steps:

### Steps
1. Copy the `signings.templates.gradle` file and rename it to `signings.gradle`.
2. Configure the related information in `signings.gradle`.
3. Use the command line to navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following:
```shell
# windows
.\gradlew clean buildReleaseTask
# linux
gradle clean buildReleaseTask
```
The naming convention is as follows:
```txt
assemble/bundle  Xiaomi  Debug/Release
```
`assemble` generates APKs,
`bundle` generates AABs,
`Xiaomi` is the name of the channel package; refer to the `productFlavors {}` configuration in flavors.gradle for the specified location,
`Debug/Release` stands for Test version/Official version.
4. After the execution is complete, you can find the generated program at the following location:
```txt
siyuan-android\app\build-release\siyuan-${versionName}-all
```
